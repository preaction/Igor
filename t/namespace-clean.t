=head1 DESCRIPTION

This test ensures that the API of the Igor::Emitter role is kept to
a minimum, and any imported subs are cleaned up before the role is
composed into a class. Any new methods must be added here, but only
after it's certain there's no way to add the functionality without
a new method.
